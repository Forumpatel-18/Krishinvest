<h4>
The agriculture sector is the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing about 15% to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and more importantly, about half of its population is wholly or substantially reliant on agriculture and related activities for their livelihood.#(Gross Value Added by agriculture, forestry, and fishing was estimated at Rs. 19.48 lakh crore (US$ 276.37 billion) in FY20.)

### Project Objective
<h4>
The kernel agenda of the Business Plan is to bridge the gap between Farmers and Investors and thus energize and strengthen the economy of India. The massive challenges faced by farmers are unemployment and underemployment be it due to environmental reasons or economical issues. In this plan we provide farmers with a chance to dilate their business by incorporating investment from investors as well as supervised help from our certified and trained Specialists. For Investors our goal is to provide a reliable and high yield return asset as compared to other ubiquitous investments.

<h4/>
Empowerment of the small and marginal farmers through education, reforms and development will ensure a better, efficient and strengthen Indian agriculture. Our Project promotes  as well as espouses entrepreneurship  among the young generation of India and at the same time dispenses quality education to both farmers as well as the investors about agriculture which is the backbone of our country. <h4/>
